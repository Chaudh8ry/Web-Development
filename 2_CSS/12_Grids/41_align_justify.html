<!-- justify-content: This property is used to align grid items along the row axis (horizontally). It works similarly to justify-content in Flexbox.

justify-content: start: Items are packed toward the start of the grid container.
justify-content: end: Items are packed toward the end of the grid container.
justify-content: center: Items are centered within the grid container.
justify-content: space-between: Items are evenly distributed in the grid container; the first item is at the start, the last item is at the end.
justify-content: space-around: Items are evenly distributed in the grid container with equal space around them.
justify-content: space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed in the grid container with equal space around them, including space before the first item and after the last item. -->

<!-- align-content: This property is used to align grid items along the column axis (vertically).

align-content: start: Lines are packed toward the start of the grid container.
align-content: end: Lines are packed toward the end of the grid container.
align-content: center: Lines are centered within the grid container.
align-content: space-between: Lines are evenly distributed in the grid container; the first line is at the start, the last line is at the end.
align-content: space-around: Lines are evenly distributed in the grid container with equal space around them.
align-content: stretch: Lines stretch to take up the remaining space. -->
