Implicit Grid:
The implicit grid is created automatically by grid items that are placed outside the bounds of the explicit grid.
It consists of rows and columns created to accommodate grid items that do not fit within the explicitly defined grid.
Grid items placed outside the explicitly defined grid will generate additional rows and columns in the implicit grid to contain them. 
*/


/* The explicit grid is defined explicitly by the grid container using properties like grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas.
It consists of rows and columns that are explicitly defined by the developer.
Grid items placed within the explicit grid are positioned based on the explicitly defined rows and columns. */
